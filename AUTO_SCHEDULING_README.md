# 🚀 Automatic Payment Scheduling System

## ✅ **Implementation Complete**

The automatic payment scheduling system has been successfully implemented and integrated into the customer creation process.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **EMI Customers:**
1. **When Added**: Automatically schedules all EMI payments based on joining date
2. **Due Dates**: EMI payments due on same day of month as joining date
3. **Overdue Logic**: EMI marked overdue 5 days after due date
4. **Example**: Customer joins on 15th → EMI due on 15th of each month

### **Rental Customers:**
1. **When Added**: 
   - Calculates pro-rated first month rent: `(monthly_rent / 30) * days_until_next_month`
   - Schedules all past months from joining to current month
   - Future rents auto-scheduled on 1st of each month
2. **Due Dates**: All rental payments due on 5th of month
3. **Overdue Logic**: Rentals marked overdue 5 days after 5th (i.e., after 10th)

## 📅 **Daily Status Checks**

The system performs automatic daily checks:

### **1st of Month:**
- Schedules new rental payments for all active rental customers
- Only runs once per day (cached in localStorage)

### **5th+ of Month:**
- Marks unpaid rental and EMI payments as overdue
- Only runs once per day to prevent multiple checks

## 🎯 **Integration Points**

### **Customer Creation** (`AddCustomerModal.tsx`)
- **EMI**: Auto-schedules all EMI payments when customer created
- **Rental**: Auto-schedules pro-rated first rent + all past months
- **Feedback**: Shows success/failure messages with details

### **App Startup** (`App.tsx` → `AutoSchedulingProvider`)
- Automatically runs daily status check when app loads
- Uses localStorage to ensure only one check per day

### **Services** (`AutoSchedulingService.ts`)
- Contains all scheduling logic
- Handles EMI and rental payment calculations
- Manages daily status checks and overdue processing

## 🧪 **Testing the System**

### **Test EMI Customer:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Customers → Add Customer
2. Select "EMI" payment type
3. Fill in:
   - Total Amount: ₹100,000
   - Down Payment: ₹20,000
   - EMI Count: 12 months
   - Join Date: Any date
4. Submit and check success message
5. Verify EMI schedule in database or payments page

### **Test Rental Customer:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Customers → Add Customer
2. Select "Monthly Rent" payment type
3. Fill in:
   - Monthly Rent: ₹5,000
   - Join Date: Any past date
4. Submit and check success message
5. Verify pro-rated first rent and all monthly rents created

### **Test Daily Checks:**
1. **Force Daily Check**: Open browser console and run:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('last_daily_check_date');
   window.location.reload();
   ```
2. Check console logs for daily check execution
3. Verify new rents scheduled (if 1st) or overdue marked (if 5th+)

## 📊 **Database Impact**

### **Tables Updated:**
- **`emis`**: Auto-populated when EMI customers created
- **`monthly_rents`**: Auto-populated when rental customers created
- **Payment Status**: Automatically updated to 'overdue' when appropriate

### **Timing:**
- **Customer Creation**: Immediate scheduling
- **Daily Checks**: Once per day on app load
- **Overdue Updates**: Automatic on 5th+ of month

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **Grace Periods:**
- **EMI**: 5 days after due date
- **Rental**: 5 days after 5th (i.e., after 10th)

### **Due Date Logic:**
- **EMI**: Same day of month as joining date
- **Rental**: Always 5th of month

### **Pro-rated Calculation:**
```javascript
proRatedAmount = (monthly_rent / daysInMonth) * daysUntilNextMonth
```

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
2. **Accurate**: Proper pro-rated calculations
3. **Efficient**: Daily checks prevent 24/7 background processing
4. **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback on scheduling results
5. **Robust**: Error handling and fallback mechanisms

## 🔍 **Monitoring**

### **Check Logs:**
- Browser console shows detailed scheduling logs
- Success/failure messages in UI toasts
- Database records created automatically

### **Verify Scheduling:**
1. **EMI Schedule**: Check `emis` table for customer_id
2. **Rental Schedule**: Check `monthly_rents` table for customer_id
3. **Daily Checks**: Check console logs on app startup

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **EMI Not Scheduled:**
- Verify `payment_type = 'emi'`
- Check all required fields (totalAmount, emiCount, joinDate)
- Review console for error messages

### **Rental Not Scheduled:**
- Verify `payment_type = 'monthly_rent'`
- Check monthlyRent field is filled
- Review console for error messages

### **Daily Check Not Running:**
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('last_daily_check_date')`
- Reload app and check console logs
- Verify AutoSchedulingProvider is loaded

## 📈 **Future Enhancements**

1. **Notification System**: SMS/Email reminders for due payments
2. **Payment Links**: Auto-generate payment links for customers
3. **Late Fees**: Automatic late fee calculation for overdue payments
4. **Customer Portal**: Self-service payment tracking
5. **Analytics**: Payment behavior and trend analysis
